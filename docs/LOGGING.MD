# Logging and panic recovery in handlers

## Overview

- Application logging setting in [main.go](..%2Fcmd%2Fserver%2Fmain.go)
- Adding attributes from the context in [log.go](..%2Finternal%2Fpkg%2Flog%2Flog.go)
- Panic recovery is here [panic_recovery_test.go](..%2Ftest%2Fintegration%2Fpanic_recovery_test.go)

## Panic recovery
ðŸ’¡I used middleware for an endpoint to recover panic that can happen in endpoint handlers. Because

âœ… It allows us to log panic errors with full context information. 

ðŸ’¡ I also used panic recovery in the transport layer to recover panic that can happen in transport layers, because endpoint middleware doesn't catch panic that can happen in the transport layer.
