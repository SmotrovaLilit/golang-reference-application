### Example of testing that application log information with fields from context [handler_test.go](..%2Finternal%2Fapplication%2Fcommands%2Fapproveprogramversion%2Fhandler_test.go)

ðŸ’¡I did it for one command for example. It can be done for all commands and queries, but not all projects need 100% coverage. It depends on the project.

ðŸ’¡If the project require test logging too, it can be done by providing logger in http and application layers. Using slog.Default doesn't allow to test logging.
